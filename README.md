## 📖 About the Project

The **GSG Asset Importer** was created to make working with  
[Greyscalegorilla](https://greyscalegorilla.com/) assets inside **3ds Max + Octane Renderer** faster and easier.  

Instead of manually setting up each texture, HDRI, or FBX, this tool automates the process, saving time for motion designers, 3D artists, and anyone using Octane in their daily workflow.

### Why this project?
- ⚡ Speed up look-development with instant Octane materials.  
- 🖥 No more manual shader or node setup — everything is auto-connected.  
- 🌍 Easy HDRI loading for realistic lighting.  
- 🛠 Designed to be lightweight, clean, and extendable.  

This is an **unofficial tool** (not affiliated with Greyscalegorilla or OTOY) created by [Iman Shirani](https://github.com/imanshirani) for the 3D community.
